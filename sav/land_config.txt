This is the loading file for the land in the game.
Be sure to have a uniform rectangular/square input.
These are some examples of correct input:
    1001    |   10
    1010    |   01

Enter this input below the "---"

The area of the input defines the land mass of the farm. A 3x3 input will produce 3x3 tiles.
A 2x3 will produce 2x3 tiles and so on

You can input 1 if you desire the specific tile to have rocks.
Otherwise, input 0

DO NOT enter uneven input. This will lead to undefined behaviors. Example of uneven input:
    1001
    101
DO NOT add another new line after the "---" Immediately enter you input
DO NOT modify the line containing "---"

Enjoy!
